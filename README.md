# Synergistic Ensemble Learning for Neonatal Health Assessment: Maximizing Accuracy through Model Integration

Neonatal health assessment is crucial for the early detection and intervention of potential health risks for newborns. This research presents a unique method that enhances the accuracy of neonatal health assessments using synergistic ensemble learning techniques. The method utilizes a dataset from Kaggle, which includes features extracted from cardiotocogram (CTG) readings.

## Introduction

This project aims to predict newborn health outcomes based on CTG readings, by employing various machine learning models, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, and XGBoost. These models are trained on features extracted from the CTG readings to predict the health status of newborns.

The predictions from these individual models are then combined using a voting classifier, which significantly improves the accuracy of the predictions. The ensemble model achieves an accuracy of 99.04%, demonstrating the effectiveness of ensemble learning in neonatal health evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this research is sourced from Kaggle and contains features extracted from cardiotocogram (CTG) readings, including:

- Baseline value
- Fetal movement
- Abnormal short-term variability
- Mean value of short-term variability
- Mean value of long-term variability
- Histogram width
- Histogram min, max, mode, mean, median, and variance

The target variable is the fetal health outcome, which includes three categories: Normal, Suspect, and Pathological.

## Code Overview

The code provided in this repository includes the following functionalities:

- Data preprocessing: Scaling the features using StandardScaler.
- Exploratory data analysis: Visualizing the relationships between features and fetal health outcomes using scatter plots and box plots.
- Model training: Training various machine learning models on the preprocessed data, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost, etc.
- Ensemble learning: Combining predictions from multiple models using voting classifier, stacking, and blending techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

## Conclusion

The results of this research underline the value of model integration for achieving better prediction performance in neonatal health assessment. By combining predictions from multiple machine learning models using ensemble learning techniques,demonstrating a significant improvement in accuracy, which can aid healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention of potential health risks for newborns.
